Plugin for Rhythmbox to inhibit the Gnome screensaver while music is playing.  The PowerManager plugin that is currently ships with
Rhythmbox no longer seems to work, this should replace it.

#Installation
Clone this repo and copy to your ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins directory.  You can then enable in Rhythmbox Plugins menu.
